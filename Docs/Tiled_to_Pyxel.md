# Going from Tiled to Pyxel
1. Open Tiled and make sure the tileset is saved as an external \*.json tileset.
2. Import the tileset image into Pyxel
3. Rename the layer to Sheet and Save.
4. Drag & drop the \*.pyxel file onto Tyxel.exe to generate a Tyxel project.
This project will have the same name as your \*.pyxel file, but with a \*.json extension.
5. Close Tyxel and open the project file in Notepad or your json editor of choice.
6. Edit the "OutputDir" and "Name" values to match your Tiled external tileset.
7. Make a backup of the original Tiled tileset as a precaution.
8. Drag & drop the Tyxel project onto Tyxel.exe again to start observing changes in the \*.pyxel file.
9. Open Tiled to make sure your map still appears intact.
